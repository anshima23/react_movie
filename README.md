## 📚  Learning Goals
This project provides an excellent opportunity to:

- Build a dynamic and interactive platform using React.
- Implement AI-driven algorithms for content recommendations.
- Develop a real-time, collaborative movie-watching experience using WebSockets.
- Gain hands-on experience with multi-platform integration (Web, Mobile, TV).
- Enhance UX/UI design skills by creating a seamless browsing and viewing experience.
- Improve your understanding of backend architecture by integrating streaming services.

## 🎯 Issues & Limitations
🚧 Limited Movie Metadata: The platform relies on external APIs to fetch movie details, and limitations in available metadata could impact certain features (e.g., missing cast details or trailers).

🚧 Mobile Optimization: While the platform is responsive, there is still room for improving the mobile interface for a smoother experience.

🚧 Streaming Quality Variations: Depending on the network, streaming quality may fluctuate, affecting the viewing experience.
